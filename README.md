# Custom Adaptive boosting from AI alchemist

This repository contains the AI alchemist's investigation and implementation for Adaboost.

## Project Overview
AdaBoost, or Adaptive Boosting, is a machine learning ensemble technique that combines multiple "weak" classifiers to form a "strong" classifier. This project focuses on:

-Deriving and explaining the core mathematical principles behind AdaBoost.

-Implementing the algorithm from scratch in Python.

-Demonstrating its application on an example dataset with clear visualizations.

## Environment Setup
To reproduce the results, ensure you have the following software and library versions installed:

- **Python**: 3.12.5
- **NumPy**: 2.0.1
- **Pandas**: 2.2.2
- **Matplotlib**: 3.9.1
- **Scikit-learn**: 1.5.1
