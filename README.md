# Custom Adaptive boosting from AI alchemist

This repository contains the AI alchemist's investigation and implementation for Adaboost.

# Project Overview
AdaBoost, or Adaptive Boosting, is a machine learning ensemble technique that combines multiple "weak" classifiers to form a "strong" classifier. This project focuses on:

-Deriving and explaining the core mathematical principles behind AdaBoost.
-Implementing the algorithm from scratch in Python.
-Demonstrating its application on an example dataset with clear visualizations.

# Environment Setup
To reproduce the results, ensure you have the following software and library versions installed:

Python: 3.12.5
NumPy: 2.0.1
Pandas: 2.2.2
Matplotlib: 3.9.1
Scikit-learn: 1.5.1
