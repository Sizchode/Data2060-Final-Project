# Data2060-Final-Project Team AI alchemist



# Finished: 
Overview of Adaboost
Give an overview of the algorithm and describe its advantages and disadvantages.
Representation: describe how the feature values are converted into a single number prediction.
Loss: describe the metric used to measure the difference between the model’s prediction and the target variable.
Optimizer: describe the numerical algorithm used to find the model parameters that minimize the loss for a training set.
Use markdown in the jupyter notebook, add equations to explain math, and use pseudo-code to explain how numerical algorithms work.

# In progress:
Model
This section is one code cell which contains the class of your ML algorithm and any other helper functions. Add headers to each method and explain to the viewer what each method does and what the inputs and outputs are. Please add comments to the code as well! 

Check model
This section is a collection of code and markdown cells that contain the unit tests and a demonstration that your implementation can reproduce previous results. 

There should be several unit tests. Create at least two or three unit tests per method and make sure that edge cases are properly handled. Explain either as comments or in a markdown cell what the goal of each test is and/or what edge case it tests for.

Find at least one previous work where your ML algorithm was applied on a public dataset. You can use, for example, the sklearn manual, a textbook, or a peer-reviewed publication. Include a markdown cell and describe the previous work. Demonstrate in a code cell that your implementation can successfully reproduce the previous work. Use citations and references. 

Contributions
Add one paragraph per team member and describe in detail what that team member’s contribution is to the final project.
